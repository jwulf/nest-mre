# NestJS with Zeebe

This is a fully working minimal example of the [NestJS Zeebe Connector](https://github.com/pay-k/nestjs-zeebe).

## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) is a TypeScript-powered MVC framework for developing Node.js backend applications.

[Zeebe](https://zeebe.io) is a workflow engine for microservices orchestration.

You can run a Zeebe server locally using the [Zeebe Docker profiles](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-docker-compose), or by [downloading a release](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/releases).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

By default, the application connects to a broker running on localhost. 

To connect to a remote broker, set the `ZEEBE_ADDRESS` environment variable (and `ZEEBE_CLIENT_ID` and `ZEEBE_CLIENT_SECRET` if you are using the [Zeebe service on Camunda Cloud](https://zeebe.io/cloud/)).

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
